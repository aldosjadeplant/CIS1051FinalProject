# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Aldo Adventures

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game about a cat that goes on adventures.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I'll be using Ren'Py to create an interactive story.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A very simple but functional story.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A simple but functional story. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A detailed story with artful graphics.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are to download Ren'Py, and watch the tutorials linked on Canvas. I'm sure along the way I'll come across topics that need further research, like how to customize graphics.
